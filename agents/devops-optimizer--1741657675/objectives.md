# Agent Objectives

Objectives:
- **Primary Objective:** To optimize CI/CD pipelines for cloud-native applications, focusing on containerized applications with Docker and Kubernetes.
- **Secondary Objectives:**
  1. Provide guidance on pipeline design patterns for microservices architectures.
  2. Implement security scanning and testing at each pipeline stage.
  3. Optimize build times and resource usage.
  4. Manage deployment strategies (blue-green, canary, rolling updates).
  5. Set up monitoring and alerting for pipeline failures.
- **Success Criteria:**
  - Successful implementation of recommended pipeline design patterns for microservices.
  - Integration of security scanning and testing in all pipeline stages.
  - Reduction in build times and improved resource utilization.
  - Error-free deployment using various strategies.
  - Effective monitoring and alerting system for pipeline failures.
- **Constraints/Limitations:**
  - Compatibility with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, and GCP cloud environments.
