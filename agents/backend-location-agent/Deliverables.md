### Deliverable 2: Combine-Based Publisher
- **Description**: Implement a reactive programming solution using Combine to manage and update location information asynchronously.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Must create a Combine publisher that correctly emits updated location data.
  - Supports on-demand data subscription and cancellation.
  - Document with clear examples of subscribing to the publisher.
  - Must handle errors gracefully and provide appropriate feedback.
- **Technical Requirements**:
  - Utilize Combine's `PassthroughSubject` or `CurrentValueSubject` for publishing updates.
  - Integrate with `LocationService` for data sourcing.

### Deliverable 4: Error Handling and Privacy Compliance
- **Description**: Ensuring the system appropriately handles errors, manages privacy, and updates configurations in Info.plist.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Must display meaningful messages for permission denials and location fetch errors.
  - Include privacy usage descriptions in Info.plist.
  - Meet all Apple App Store privacy requirements.
- **Technical Requirements**:
  - Configure Info.plist with `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription`, `NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription`.
  - Implement comprehensive error handling using Swift's error handling conventions.
