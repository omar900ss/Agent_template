   - Configure the development environment with necessary tools and plugins.

2. **Project Initialization**
   - Create a new Xcode project.
   - Import essential frameworks: CoreLocation, MapKit, and Combine.

3. **Team Familiarization**
   - Conduct team orientations on technologies: Swift, Combine, CoreLocation.
   - Set up project management and collaboration tools.

### Resource Requirements
- **Human Resources**: 
  - Swift developers proficient in iOS development.
  - DevOps engineer for environment setup.
- **Technical Resources**:
  - Access to the latest Mac hardware with required software licenses.
  - Version control system setup (e.g., GitHub).

### Dependencies
- Successful installation of Xcode is necessary for project initialization.
- Team familiarization is dependent on access to all necessary tools and resources.

## Phase 2: Core Development Phase (Primary Functionality)
- **Duration**: ~40% of Development Time
- **Objective**: Develop the core functionality of the backend location services.

### Milestones
1. **Location Service Module Development**
   - Implement the `LocationService` class for location data management.
   - Develop logic for managing user location permissions.

2. **Combine-based Publishers**
   - Implement publishers for asynchronous handling of location data.

### Resource Requirements
- **Human Resources**:
  - Experienced iOS developers with expertise in Combine and Swift.
- **Technical Resources**:
  - Access to a testing suite for iterative development and verification.

### Dependencies
- Completion of the Foundation Phase, ensuring the environment is fully set up.
- Availability of team members skilled in Combine and Swift for complex feature implementations.

---

## Phase 3: Integration Phase (System Integration and Testing)
- **Duration**: ~20% of Development Time
- **Objective**: Seamlessly integrate location services into UI components and ensure system reliability.

### Milestones
1. **SwiftUI Component Integration**
   - Utilize `@StateObject` and other features for real-time data binding.
   - Develop user interfaces to display location data.

2. **System Testing and Bug Fixing**
   - Conduct functional testing of location data retrieval and UI integration.

### Resource Requirements
- **Human Resources**:
  - UI/UX designers for UI component development.
  - QA engineers for system testing.
- **Technical Resources**:
  - Setup of a real-world testing environment that simulates different location scenarios.

### Dependencies
- Core Development Phase completion is necessary to provide functional backend services.
- Dependency on QA resources for extensive testing and feedback implementation.

---

## Phase 4: Optimization Phase (Performance Tuning)
- **Duration**: ~15% of Development Time
- **Objective**: Enhance system performance and prepare for deployment.

### Milestones
1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize location update frequency and power consumption.
   - Refine error handling and state management.

2. **Final Testing and Debugging**
   - Conduct a final round of performance testing and debugging.

### Resource Requirements
- **Human Resources**:
  - Senior developers for optimization tasks.
- **Technical Resources**:
  - Access to profiling tools (Instruments in Xcode).

### Dependencies
- Completion of Integration Phase is required to begin optimization.
- Performance data from testing phases to identify bottlenecks.

---

## Notes
- It is critical that each phase is meticulously reviewed upon completion before progressing to the next phase to ensure all milestones and deliverables are met.
- Continual iteration and refinement should be expected, especially when integrating and testing new features.
