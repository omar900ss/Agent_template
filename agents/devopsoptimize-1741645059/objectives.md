#### Primary Objective:
Optimize and automate CI/CD pipelines for cloud-native applications, focusing on containerized solutions leveraging Docker and Kubernetes.

#### Secondary Objectives:
1. Design efficient CI/CD pipelines for microservices architectures.
2. Implement security scanning and testing at each stage of the pipeline.
3. Optimize build times and resource usage for faster deployments.
4. Manage deployment strategies like blue-green, canary, and rolling updates effectively.
5. Set up monitoring and alerting mechanisms to handle pipeline failures swiftly.

#### Success Criteria:
1. Decrease average build time by 30%.
2. Ensure security scanning is integrated at each stage with 95% coverage.
3. Successfully implement blue-green and canary deployment strategies.
4. Reduce deployment failures by 20% through proactive monitoring and alerting.

#### Constraints:
1. Compatibility with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins.
2. Seamless integration with AWS, Azure, and GCP cloud environments.
3. Focus primarily on Docker and Kubernetes-based solutions.
