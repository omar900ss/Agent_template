# Backend Agent Objectives Specification File

## Objective 1: Integration with RevenueCat SDK

- **Description**: Seamlessly integrate RevenueCat's SDK to handle the app's subscription status, payment logic, and purchase validation.
- **Importance**: This integration is crucial for managing purchases, subscriptions, and entitlements efficiently, serving as the foundation for the paywall logic.
- **Success Criteria**: 
  - All subscription events are accurately logged.
  - Subscription state changes correctly reflect in the app.
  - 100% error-free integration with no runtime exceptions during purchase events.
- **Priority**: High, as it is fundamental for enabling monetization features in the app.

## Objective 2: Entitlement Synchronization

- **Description**: Develop a system that regularly updates and synchronizes user entitlement status and purchase history.
- **Importance**: Ensures users have consistent access to their respective subscription benefits across devices and protects revenue by accurately reflecting subscription states.
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Synchronization intervals not exceeding 15 minutes.
  - 100% accuracy in reflected entitlement states.
  - Zero discrepancy cases in user reports.
- **Priority**: High, due to its direct impact on user experience and satisfaction.

## Objective 3: Robust Webhook Handling

- **Description**: Implement a resilient webhook handling system that updates the backend database with changes in purchase and entitlement data.
- **Importance**: This ensures real-time updates are processed effectively, minimizing latency in user entitlement changes and reducing potential disputes.
- **Success Criteria**:
  - All webhooks processed within 2 seconds.
  - No lost webhook data in error logs.
  - Successful retry mechanisms for failed deliveries.
- **Priority**: Medium, but essential for maintaining reliability of real-time updates.

## Objective 4: Support for A/B Testing and Optimization

- **Description**: Enable A/B testing capabilities and optimization features for paywall designs, leveraging RevenueCat's experimentation tools.
- **Importance**: Enhances user engagement and maximizes conversion rates by testing different paywall designs and strategies.
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Successful execution of at least two A/B test campaigns per quarter.
  - A documented increase in conversion rates from test outcomes.
  - Comprehensive data analytics after each campaign to guide future designs.
- **Priority**: Medium; though not vital for initial integration, it is essential for long-term optimization.

## Objective 5: Remote Paywall Configuration

- **Description**: Facilitate the ability to configure paywalls remotely via RevenueCat to avoid frequent app updates.
- **Importance**: Reduces operational overhead by allowing dynamic updates to pricing and offers without the need for app releases, ensuring agility in marketing strategies.
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Deployment of new paywall configurations without app updates.
  - Zero downtime during configuration changes.
  - Successfully applied changes verified within the app interface within 5 minutes.
- **Priority**: Medium, focusing on streamlining operations and enhancing flexibility. 

This objectives specification file provides a structured roadmap for the Backend Agentâ€™s efforts in developing a robust, flexible, and monetization-enhancing paywall system, aligned with organizational goals and user needs.
