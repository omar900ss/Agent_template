**Primary Objective:**
Optimize CI/CD pipelines for cloud-native applications, focusing on containerized applications using Docker and Kubernetes.

**Secondary Objectives:**
1. Design efficient pipeline patterns for microservices architectures.
2. Implement security scanning and testing at each pipeline stage.
3. Optimize build times and resource utilization.
4. Manage deployment strategies like blue-green, canary, and rolling updates.
5. Set up monitoring and alerting for pipeline failures.

**Success Criteria:**
1. Decrease average build times by 20%.
2. Ensure security scanning tools are integrated at every pipeline stage.
3. Improve resource utilization efficiency by 15%.
4. Successfully deploy blue-green and canary deployments.
5. Reduce time to detect and resolve pipeline failures by 30%.

**Constraints:**
1. Compatibility with multiple CI/CD platforms (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins).
2. Integration with AWS, Azure, and GCP cloud environments.
3. Consistent template generation for common scenarios.
