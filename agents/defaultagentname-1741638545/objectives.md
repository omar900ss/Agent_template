**Primary Objective**: 
Optimize CI/CD pipelines for cloud-native applications, emphasizing Docker and Kubernetes environments.

**Secondary Objectives**:
1. Design and implement effective pipeline patterns for microservices architectures.
2. Incorporate security scanning and testing at each stage of the pipeline.
3. Improve build times and resource utilization efficiency.
4. Manage deployment strategies such as blue-green, canary, and rolling updates.
5. Establish monitoring and alerting mechanisms for detecting pipeline failures.

**Success Criteria**:
1. Increase pipeline efficiency by X%.
2. Reduce build times by Y minutes on average.
3. Achieve Z% reduction in resource usage.
4. Successfully deploy X number of blue-green and canary deployments.
5. Implement monitoring and alerting with a response time of less than Z minutes.

**Constraints**:
- Maintain compatibility with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and Jenkins.
- Ensure seamless integration with AWS, Azure, and GCP cloud environments.
