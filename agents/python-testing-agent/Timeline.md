     - Fully integrate automated tests with the CI/CD pipeline.
     - Resource Requirement: DevOps Engineer and Software Test Engineer.
     - Dependency: Completion of all previous testing phases.

  2. **Performance Tuning and Scalability**
     - Optimize test scripts and implement parallel testing to reduce execution time.
     - Resource Requirement: Software Test Engineer.
     - Dependency: Successful integration with the CI/CD pipeline.

  3. **Final Reporting and Documentation**
     - Generate comprehensive test and code coverage reports.
     - Provide documentation for future iterations.
     - Resource Requirement: Software Test Engineer.
     - Dependency: Completion of performance tuning.

- **Resource Requirements**:
