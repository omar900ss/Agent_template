**Deliverables Specification File: Frontend Paywall Design Agent**

---

### Deliverable 1: Paywall Design Mockups

- **Description**: High-fidelity design mockups of the paywall in SwiftUI, reflecting a minimalist black/white theme inspired by Uber. This design will provide two distinct subscription plans: free and premium.

- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - The mockups must align with the minimalist aesthetic, emphasizing simplicity and a sleek look.
  - Must include design variations for different screen sizes (e.g., iPhone, iPad).
  - Clearly differentiate between the free and premium plans visually.

- **Technical Requirements**:
  - Use design tools compatible with SwiftUI prototyping (e.g., Figma or Sketch).
  - Ensure the color code matches the Uber theme (Black: #000000, White: #FFFFFF).
  - Mockups must be exportable in resolution suitable for multiple devices (e.g., @1x, @2x, @3x scaling).

### Deliverable 2: Paywall Implementation Code

- **Description**: Swift and SwiftUI code implementing the paywall design within the app, integrating with an SDK for managing in-app purchases.

- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Code must be organized, documented, and utilize best practices for SwiftUI development.
  - The paywall should function correctly within a test environment, offering both free and premium plans.
  - Must ensure smooth integration with selected SDKs like Superwall or RevenueCat if used.

- **Technical Requirements**:
  - Compatible with iOS 14.0 and above.
  - Follow Apple's Human Interface Guidelines.
  - Must pass performance checks, maintaining a stable frame rate and resource usage on test devices.

### Deliverable 3: Integration Test Reports

- **Description**: A series of test reports documenting the integration process, verifying the paywall's compliance with aesthetic and functional requirements across devices.

- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - All tests must indicate successful implementation of features and design, with no critical errors.
  - Testing would confirm adjustable layout feature working across a range of devices (iPhones, iPads).
  - User experience tests should score above 85% satisfaction in usability.

- **Technical Requirements**:
  - Use XCTest or a comparable framework for testing.
  - Conduct both unit and UI testing, ensuring no regressions.
  - Report should include screenshots, logs, and a summary of issues and resolutions.

### Deliverable 4: Deployment Package

- **Description**: A ready-to-deploy package containing code, assets, and necessary documentation for the paywall component.

- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Package should build without errors in Xcode.
  - Must include all assets (e.g., images, icons) in proper formats and resolutions.
  - Provided documentation should include installation steps, configuration guides, and a maintenance plan.

- **Technical Requirements**:
  - Package compatible with both development and production environments.
  - Structured according to platform distribution guidelines (App Store Review Guidelines).
  - Secure storage of sensitive information (e.g., API keys).

### Deliverable 5: Documentation and User Guide

- **Description**: Comprehensive documentation and user guide detailing paywall features, customization options, and maintenance procedures.

- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Documentation should be clear, concise, and structured for both developers and non-technical stakeholders.
  - Must cover all aspects of the paywall, including customization and troubleshooting sections.
  - Include diagrams and code examples where applicable.

- **Technical Requirements**:
  - Available in PDF and HTML formats for accessibility.
  - Follow documentation standards for tech writing (e.g., consistent templates, glossary of terms).
  - Include a changelog template for future updates.
