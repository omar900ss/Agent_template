## 2. Secure Token Handling
- **Deliverable Name**: Token Management System
- **Description**: Develop a robust mechanism for generating, storing, and managing authentication tokens.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Tokens are generated securely following JWT standards.
  - Storage of tokens in secure environments, preferably HTTPOnly cookies or local encrypted storage.
  - Expired tokens should not grant access; ensure proper invalidation handling.

  - Ensure encryption and decryption processes follow industry standards (e.g., AES).

## 3. Social Login Integration
- **Deliverable Name**: OAuth/OpenID Connect Integration
- **Description**: Integrate third-party authentication options using OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Successfully authenticate users via Google, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
  - Ensure seamless integration without disrupting user experience.
- **Technical Requirements**:
  - Utilize services or libraries like Passport.js for OAuth/OpenID Connect.
  - Configure redirection and token exchange securely.

## 4. Error Handling System
- **Deliverable Name**: Authentication Error Feedback System
- **Description**: Develop a system to provide feedback messages for the authentication process.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Error messages should be informative without revealing sensitive data.
  - Differentiate between validation errors and system errors.
- **Technical Requirements**:
  - Handle errors using try-catch blocks and proper logging.
  - Provide localized messages for international users.

## 5. Security Features
- **Deliverable Name**: Enhanced Security Measures
- **Description**: Implement necessary security features to safeguard the authentication process.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - SSL/TLS encryption enabled for all communication.

- **Technical Requirements**:
  - Use tools like Helmet.js for security headers.
  - Employ services that support SSL/TLS certification, such as Let's Encrypt.

## 6. Session Management
- **Deliverable Name**: Session Management System
- **Description**: Plan and implement session management strategies.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Sessions should time out after a period of inactivity.
  - Proper handling of session cookies with HTTPOnly and Secure flags.
- **Technical Requirements**:
  - Manage sessions using Express-session or similar middleware.
  - Implement CSRF protection using tokens or libraries like csrf.

## 7. Scalable Architecture
- **Deliverable Name**: Scalable Frontend Architecture
- **Description**: Design a scalable architecture to integrate backend services seamlessly.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - System should efficiently handle increased loads and scale horizontally.
  - Use of microfrontend approach to facilitate independent deployments.
- **Technical Requirements**:
  - Utilize a modular approach with component-based frameworks like React.js.
  - Secure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings using middleware.

By fulfilling these deliverables, the agent will ensure a secure, efficient, and user-friendly authentication system aligned with industry best practices.
