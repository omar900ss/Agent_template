# Implementation Timeline

**Phase 1: Research and Development (Months 1-3)**
- Conduct market research to identify common pain points in software documentation.
- Develop algorithms for code analysis and content generation.
- Set up integration systems for popular version control and documentation tools.

**Phase 2: Prototype Development (Months 4-6)**
- Build a functional prototype with core capabilities such as code parsing and documentation generation.
- Test the prototype with sample projects to evaluate performance and accuracy.

**Phase 3: Testing and Feedback (Months 7-8)**
- Deploy the agent for beta testing with a selected group of software projects.
- Gather feedback from users and adjust features based on their needs and suggestions.

**Phase 4: Deployment and Scaling (Months 9-10)**
- Implement improvements from the feedback cycle.
- Scale the agent for broader use across different industries and project types.

**Phase 5: Evaluation and Iteration (Month 11)**
- Conduct an evaluation of the agentâ€™s impact on documentation quality and efficiency.
- Iterate on features and capabilities based on user adoption and performance metrics.

**Phase 6: Continuous Support and Updates (Month 12 Onwards)**
- Provide ongoing support and updates to ensure the agent remains effective as technology and user needs evolve.
