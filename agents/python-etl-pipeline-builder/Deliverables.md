# Python ETL Pipeline Builder Deliverables

# Deliverables Specification File: Python ETL Pipeline Builder Agent

## 1. Source Connectors

### Deliverable: Data Source Connectors
- **Description**: Modular components that enable the agent to connect to various data sources, including databases, APIs, and flat files.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Ability to establish connections to at least three types of databases.
  - Support RESTful API integrations for data extraction.
  - Enable flat file reading capabilities for formats such as CSV, JSON, and Excel.
- **Technical Requirements**:
  - Utilize Python libraries like `SQLAlchemy`, `requests`, and `pandas` for implementing connectors.
  - Ensure secure connection handling with authentication and error handling.

## 2. Data Transformation Component

### Deliverable: Pandas-Based Data Transformation Module
- **Description**: A transformation module leveraging Pandas for data cleaning, validation, and application of custom transformations.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Support for data cleaning functions (e.g., removing duplicates, handling missing values).
  - Validate data types and consistency according to predefined schemas.
  - Ability to implement custom transformations using user-defined functions.
- **Technical Requirements**:
  - Implement using the `pandas` library.
  - Include logging for transformations applied and errors encountered.

## 3. Data Loading Component

### Deliverable: PostgreSQL Data Loader
- **Description**: A component to load transformed data into PostgreSQL databases using SQLAlchemy.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Capable of loading data into PostgreSQL with specified table structures.
  - Ensure transaction safety and data integrity during loading.
  - Log successful and failed loading attempts.
- **Technical Requirements**:
  - Implement using `SQLAlchemy` and `psycopg2` libraries.
  - Support for bulk insert operations to optimize performance.

## 4. Integration with Apache Airflow

### Deliverable: Airflow DAG Integration
- **Description**: Ability to define and manage ETL workflows as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) in Apache Airflow.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Create DAGs that orchestrate ETL tasks in the correct sequence.
  - Implement task dependencies, retries, and alerts within DAGs.
  - DAGs should be easily configurable and reusable.
- **Technical Requirements**:
  - Written in Python scripts compatible with Apache Airflow.
  - Include documentation for setting up and managing DAGs.

## 5. Error Handling and Data Validation

### Deliverable: Robust Error Handling System
- **Description**: System to handle potential errors during ETL processes and ensure data integrity through validation.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Implement retry mechanisms for failed tasks with configurable retry policies.
  - Comprehensive logging of errors and task execution details.
  - Integration of data validation checks throughout the ETL process.
- **Technical Requirements**:
  - Use Python's `logging` for error logging.
  - Implement retry logic with customizable parameters.

## 6. Testing and Validation Documentation

### Deliverable: Testing and Validation Report
- **Description**: Document detailing the testing and validation processes, results, and any issues discovered during the execution.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Cover test cases for each module with expected outcomes.
  - Include results from end-to-end ETL process tests.
  - Document any issues encountered and resolution steps.
- **Technical Requirements**:
  - Use testing frameworks such as `unittest` or `pytest`.
  - Provide test scripts and results in a reproducible format.

## 7. Deployment and Monitoring Protocols

### Deliverable: Deployment and Monitoring Setup Guide
- **Description**: Guide for deploying the ETL agent and setting up monitoring to ensure ongoing reliability and performance.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Clear, step-by-step instructions for deployment in a production environment.
  - Define monitoring metrics and protocols for performance tracking.
  - Provide an incident response plan for troubleshooting issues.
- **Technical Requirements**:
  - Utilize tools like `Docker` for containerizing the agent.
  - Set up monitoring using tools like `Prometheus` and `Grafana`.

By meeting these deliverables, the Python ETL Pipeline Builder Agent will be equipped to efficiently facilitate ETL processes with modularity, robustness, and extensibility.
