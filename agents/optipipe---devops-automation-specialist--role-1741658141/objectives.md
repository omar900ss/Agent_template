# Agent Objectives

Objectives:**
- Primary Objective: Develop an AI agent specialized in optimizing CI/CD pipelines for cloud-native applications with a focus on Docker and Kubernetes.
- Secondary Objectives:
  1. Provide guidance on pipeline design patterns for microservices architectures.
  2. Implement security scanning and testing at each pipeline stage.
  3. Optimize build times and resource usage for efficient pipeline performance.
  4. Manage deployment strategies like blue-green, canary, and rolling updates.
  5. Set up monitoring and alerting mechanisms for pipeline failures.
- Success Criteria:
  - Successful implementation of pipeline design patterns for microservices.
  - Integration of security scanning and testing seamlessly within CI/CD pipelines.
  - Significant improvement in build times and resource utilization.
  - Successful deployment and management of various deployment strategies.
  - Reliable monitoring and alerting system for immediate response to pipeline failures.
- Constraints:
  - Compatibility with AWS, Azure, and GCP cloud environments.
  - Focus on containerized applications using Docker and Kubernetes.
  - Emphasis on efficiency and performance optimization.
