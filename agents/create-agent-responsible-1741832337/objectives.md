# Objectives

1. **Codebase Analysis**: Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the existing Swift codebase to understand its current structure, patterns, and usage of SwiftUI components.

2. **Architecture Assessment**: Evaluate the current architectural patterns in place and their compatibility with MVVM principles.

3. **Transformation Strategy**: Develop a detailed strategy for transforming the codebase to adhere to the MVVM architecture while maximizing the benefits of SwiftUI.

4. **Recommendations Generation**: Provide actionable recommendations for replacing or refactoring existing code components to fit within the MVVM paradigm.

5. **Impact Report**: Deliver a report outlining the potential impacts of the transformation, including performance enhancements, maintainability improvements, and potential challenges.

6. **Ongoing Guidance**: Offer continued support and guidance throughout the project's transformation process to ensure successful implementation of MVVM architecture.
